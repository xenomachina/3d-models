3D Models
=========

This is the source for some 3D models I have created for 3D printing. The
source here is OpenSCAD, and licensed under GPL v2.1.

Some of these models have STL files already available (sometimes with a different
license). Links for these are provided below.

I have also included Cura slicing profiles for some of the models here.

## [PlayStation2 Slim Stand](ps2-slim-stand/)

While lying horizontally the PlayStation 2 slim takes up a lot more space than
it has to. It is designed to also stand vertically (the logo even rotates), but
it needs a stand to hold it up. All of the stands I could find selling online
are either designed for a different revision of the PS2 slim than mine (which
lacks a screw hole) or they cover the vent holes. After my original PS3 cooked
itself to death I'm a bit paranoid about cooling.

Features of this design:

- Easily printable -- there are absolutely no overhangs.
- Doesn't use too much material (or printing time).
- Provides good ventilation.
- Provides adequate support for the PS2 so it won't tip over.
- Matches the look of the PS2.

## [Bike License Holder](bike-license-holder/)

This is a frame for holding a small bike-size license plate, like those novelty
personalized "your name here" license plates you often see in souvenir shops.
It can be attached to a bike frame with a few cable zip ties. The plate itself
can be attached with either more zip ties, or with nuts and bolts.


## [Cookie cutter](cookie-cutter/)

This is a cookie cutter. You need to have a 2D `drawing.dxf` for the cookie
cutter shape, and this will create a 3D model of an actual cookie cutter.


## [Exercise Machine Tablet Stand](exer-tablet-stand/)

I have an elliptical trainer. I wanted to be able to watch videos on a table while running on
it. I wasn't able to find a tablet stand on the market for this elliptical
trainer, so I designed this simple bracket that mounts on top of the trainer's
control panel.

The 3D printed part is needs to be printed twice, once in mirror image. You'll
also need 3/16" threaded rod with matching nylon lock nuts, some paracord (or
other strong cord), some cable zip ties, and optionally some felt or rubber
self-adhesive feet.

The two 3D-printed components hook onto the top bezel, one at the extreme left,
and one ant the extreme right. Two threaded rods connect these. Each rod has
two lock-nuts: one on each side of each 3D-printed part (so that part can't
slide left or right).

A zip tie loop is then attached to each side, as open
as possible (ie: it zip tie just "clicks" once). The cord is then tied onto
one of these, looped under the control panel and in front of the post, and back
up the other side. Pull it as tight as possible, and connect to the other zip
tie loop. Now pull both loops tighter. This will take out the last bit of slack
from the cord, holing the entire assembly onto the bezel very firmly.

Finally, a couple of self-adhesive feet can be attached to the inside of the
upward facing "hooks" to provide some padding and/or friction so your tablet
doesn't slip off. My wife and I have both been using this for months with our
different tablets, and it works great.

## [Small Wall Bracket](small-wall-bracket/)

This is a small bracket for wall-mounting things. I used it for mounting a
Global Caché GC-100 Network Adapter. It would probably also work well for
things like routers, switches, or Raspberry Pi's in boxy cases.

Two brackets are needed for each device to be wall-mounted. One bracket goes
above the device, another goes below.  The brackets screw onto the wall, and
one cable zip tie per bracket is wrapped around the device, passing through the
slot in the bracket. The device can be removed from the wall by snipping the
zip ties. (You don't need to unscrew the brackets to remove or repplace the
device.)

## [Miele Dishwasher Thingy](miele-dishwasher/)

This is a replacement part for our Miele dishwasher. It's a little clip/hinge
thing that goes in the upper rack.  The orginal part vanished, so I printed
this up. (There was originally a pair of them, so I was able to measure the
still remaining one to create this design.)

ABS or nylon would probably work best in the harsh dishwasher environment. I
just used PLA, and it did work for a few months, but eventually warped
(probably due to heat).


## ["DIY Clock My First Clock" Replacement Pendulum Pusher](diy-clock/)

My son has a "Do-It-Yourself Clock My First Clock" kit. It fell off a table,
and one part broke. This is a replacement for that part.  In our kit this part
was yellow, and it connects between the escapement's pallet and the pendulum.
The small rod snapped off of ours, hence this replacement part.

## [Monitor Arm Bridge](monitor-arm-bridge/)

**NOTE: I haven't actually printed this yet, so it's a completely untested
design.**

I have two Monoprice monitor stands that each have a vertical shaft that
mounts onto the desk. My desk has a cable port in the center, so rather than
have the stands mounted centered under their respective monitor, I have them
mounted on either side of this port. This off-center placement means the two
stands tend to bow away from each other slightly, but noticeably.

This design is a "bridge" that goes between the two monitor stands. It would
be held in place by cable ties. There is a "tunnel" through the center for
cable management.

As mentioned earlier, I have not printed this yet. For now I'm just using
cable ties, which prevents the bowing, but it does mean that my monitors can
wobble a tiny bit (mostly noticeable from the webcam mounted on top of one
of my monitors., so I may end up printing this after all, as it should make
the setup a lot more rigid than it currently is.

Caveats aside, for the most part I think this design should work well, but
the measurements will most certainly need adjusting for different mounts
diameters, mount placements, and cable tie widths.


## [Rack Spacers](rack-spacers/)

I have an AV rack (just like a network rack, but for AV equipment). Because of
where it's installed, certain cable organizers that extend past the width of
the rack cannot attach onto the back rail.
These spacers make it possible to attach onto this rail, though longer screws
are required. I would not recommend using these for anything of substantial
weight. Like I said, I only use them for cable organizers.


## [Cabinet plug](cabinet-plug/)

This is a weird one. I have some cabinets in my home that had a couple of strange
rectangular openings. These openings weren't easy to see, but ants started
using them to get into the house. I made these plugs, and then filled the
openings with "Great Stuff™" expanding foam. (The small round hole in the plugs
are for the "Great Stuff" nozzle to fit through.) These are almost certainly
not useful to anyone else unaltered, but the dimensions are all in variables,
so it's easy to customize.
