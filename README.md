3D Models
=========

This is the source for some 3D models I have created. The source here is
OpenSCAD, and licensed under GPL v2.1.

STL Files
---------

Some of these models have STL files already available (sometimes with a different
license):

- ["DIY Clock My First Clock" Replacement Pendulum Pusher](https://www.youmagine.com/designs/diy-clock-my-first-clock-replacement-pendulum-pusher)
