These are some cookie cutters that my 7-year-old son designed. He drew the
shapes on paper with a marker. We scanned these in ([scan.png](scan.png)) and
then manually traced the parts we wanted to keep in Inkscape
([shapes.svg](shapes.svg)). We exported that as drawing.dxf, and then opened
the result in OpenSCAD to produce
[halloween-cookie-cutters.stl](halloween-cookie-cutters.stl).

We used these to cut cheese slices for a Halloween party at his school.
